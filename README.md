# Poorcast

A budget application allowing for adding, deleting, editing accounts and expenses along with an overview page providing a small analysis account/expense data.

## Description

The project was built for a capstone project for [my portfolio](https://www.cameronremesz.com/). It was used to learn every step of the product development lifecycle from  initiation, planning, execution, monitoring & control, and closure.
 
This included:
- Building user stories to determine features
- Prototyping to test assumptions
- Logo/Brand graphic design in Figma/Affinity Serif
- Implementing a design system with CSS custom properties
- Determining the tech stack
- Implementing the front-end with Angular/RxJS
- Researching and implementing a data model for the backend in Google Firestore
- Implementing user authentication and password reset
- Implementing CI/CD with github actions
- Implementing automated testing with Cypress/Github actions
